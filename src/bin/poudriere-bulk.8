.Dt POUDRIERE-BULK 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm poudriere-bulk
.Nd build a ready-to-export package tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm poudriere
.Op Ar poudriere-options
.Cm bulk
.Ar subcommand
.Op Ar options
.Nm poudriere
.Op Ar poudriere-options
.Cm bulk
.Op Ar options
.Ar origin Op Ar origin2 ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command makes a ready-to-export package tree, and fills it with
binary packages built from a given list of ports.
During the build, hit ^T to send
.Dv SIGINFO
and show stats and progress about the build.
.Pp
See
.Sx FLAVORS
in
.Xr poudriere 8
for supported FLAVORS syntax.
.Pp
See
.Sx CUSTOMISATION
in
.Xr poudriere 8
to know how to build binary packages with options that differs from
defaults.
.Pp
Either a subcommand or a list of port origins must be supplied.
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl a
Build all ports in the tree with all flavors.
.It Fl f Ar file
Absolute path to a file which contains the list of ports to build.
Ports must be specified in the form
.Ar category/port
and shell-style comments are allowed.
Multiple
.Fl f Ar file
arguments may be specified at once.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl B Ar name
Specify which buildname to use.
By default
.Ar YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS
will be used.
This can be used to resume a previous build and use the same log and URL paths.
Resuming a build will not retry built/failed/skipped/ignored packages.
.It Fl c
Clean
.Em all
previously built packages and logs.
.It Fl C
Clean only the packages specified on the command line or in the file given by
.Fl f Ar file .
Implies
.Fl c
for
.Fl a .
.It Fl F
Only fetch from original MASTER_SITES.
Skip
.Fx
mirrors.
.It Fl j Ar name
Run the bulk build on the jail named
.Ar name .
.It Fl J Ar number[:number]
This argument specifies how many
.Ar number
jobs will run in parallel for a bulk build.
The optional second
.Ar number
is the number of jobs used for the steps before the build, they are more IO
bound than CPU bound, so you may want to use a different number.
The default pre-build value is 1.25 times the value of the build value.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode.
Enter jail for interactive testing and automatically cleanup when done.
A local
.Xr pkg.conf 5
repository configuration will be installed to
.Pa LOCALBASE/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
so that
.Xr pkg 8
can be used with any existing packages built for the jail.
The
.Fx
repository will be disabled by default.
.It Fl I
Advanced Interactive mode.
Leaves jail running with ports installed after test.
When done with the jail you will need to manually shut it down:
.Dl "poudriere jail -k -j JAILNAME" .
As with
.Fl i
this will install a
.Xr pkg.conf 5
file for
.Xr pkg 8
usage.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Show what would be done, but do not actually build or delete any
packages.
.It Fl N
Do not build package repository when build is completed.
.It Fl p Ar tree
This flag specifies on which ports
.Ar tree
the bulk build will be done.
.It Fl R
Clean RESTRICTED packages after building.
.It Fl S
Do not recursively rebuild packages affected by other packages requiring
incremental rebuild.
This may result in broken packages if the ones they depend on are updated,
are not ABI-compatible, and were not properly
.Sy PORTREVISION
bumped.
.It Fl t
Add some testing to the specified ports.
Add
.Fl r
to recursively test all port dependencies as well.
Currently uninstalls the port, and disable parallel
jobs for make.
When used with
.Fl a
then
.Fl rk
are implied.
.It Fl r
Recursively test all dependencies as well.
This flag is automatically set when using
.Fl at .
.It Fl k
When using
.Fl t
do not consider failures as fatal.
Do not skip dependent ports on findings.
This flag is automatically set when using
.Fl at .
.It Fl T
Try building BROKEN ports by defining TRYBROKEN for the build.
.It Fl w
Save WRKDIR on build failure.
The WRKDIR will be tarred up into
.Sy ${POUDRIERE_DATA}/wrkdirs .
.It Fl v
This will show more information during the build.
Specify twice to enable debug output.
.It Fl z Ar set
This specifies which SET to use for the build.
See
.Sx CUSTOMISATION
in
.Xr poudriere 8
for examples of how this is used.
